# ChickWeight Analysis
An in-depth statistical analysis of the R data preset “ChickWeight”.

# Description
This group project performs an in-depth statistical analysis of the R data preset “ChickWeight” (Weight versus age of chicks on different diets). The aim was to find out which variables affect the weight of the chicken and to formulate conclusions as if I was helping the farmer who gathered the data and who want the chicken to be as heavy as possible so he or she could sell them for a higher price.

It includes the following statistical analyses:

- Descriptive statistics
- Factor analysis
- Cluster analysis
- ANOVA
- Regression model

The code is well commented, both from a technical as well as statistical standpoint. My aim was that anyone who finds my code on github would be able to understand, modify and use it. It is split into a lot of sections which can be collapsed. Experience R coders can therefore easily skip sections that are not relevant for them.
